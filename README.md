# Franklin Unlocking Tool

This tool is designed to allow owners of the T-Mobile Franklin T9 hotspot to unlock their device for use with other carriers. The tool can be accessed [here](http://steftodor.github.io/franklin-unlock).

The logic for the unlock code was discovered by Server Network Tech [read their full write-up for more technical information about the device.](https://snt.sh/2020/09/rooting-the-t-mobile-t9-franklin-wireless-r717) 

Yes, this is a highly complex way of approaching retrieval of the unlock code, considering the unlock code could be generated through the command line; however, I created this site to get my foot in the door with React and Material UI.
